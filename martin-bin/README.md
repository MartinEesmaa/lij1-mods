# Installation of Martin Eesmaa's LIJ1 character

NOTE: It is an experimental documentation, sorry about that.

To install the character file, you must have copy of Lego Indiana Jones 1: The Original Adventures from PC version only. The console versions do not work.

And most importantly, it has to be extracted with QuickBMS and the ttgames.bms script.

For example to replace Indiana Jones character...

## New instruction

You can copy the CHARS\INDIANAJONES folder to Lego Indiana Jones 1 root game folder.

## Old instruction (deprecated)

You can copy (recommended) or rename it:

Windows:

```batch
copy MARTINEESMAA_PC.GHG INDIANAJONES_PC.GHG
copy MARTINEESMAA_LR_PC.GHG INDIANAJONES_LR_PC.GHG
```

Linux:

```bash
cp MARTINEESMAA_PC.GHG INDIANAJONES_PC.GHG
cp MARTINEESMAA_LR_PC.GHG INDIANAJONES_LR_PC.GHG
```

Please go to directory from LIJ1 root folder called:

```bash
CHARS\INDIANAJONES
```

Make sure you backup the file of `INDIANAJONES_PC.GHG` and `INDIANAJONES_LR_PC.GHG` original from `CHARS\INDIANAJONES` to somewhere. Paste two files into `CHARS\INDIANAJONES` from Lego Indiana Jones 1 root folder.

And that's it!
